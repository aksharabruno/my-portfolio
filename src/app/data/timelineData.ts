        description: "I'm studying Computer Science (joint degree) at UvA and VU, focused on Software Engineering and Green IT. Between writing code and breaking it (sometimes on purpose), I’m exploring cool stuff like adaptive software, microservices, and system design. Most days, it's me vs. the compiler… and the compiler usually wins.",

        description: "During my 2 years as a Developer at Envestnet, Inc., I brought UI/UX designs to life using ReactJS, making sure everything looked great and worked smoothly across screens. Redux helped me keep the app’s state under control, even when things got complex. I teamed up with designers, backend devs, and product folks to ship features that actually made users happy—and yes, I wrote plenty of unit tests to catch bugs before they could cause chaos.",

I wrote engaging content and designed eye-catching posters for their Instagram page, making sure the feed stayed fresh and on-brand. I also kept the page actively buzzing with the audience and even jumped into customer service now and then, just to keep things interesting.",

        description: "I did my Bachelor’s in Computer Science at Sree Chitra Thirunal College of Engineering (SCT). It’s where I picked up the fundamentals—coding, algorithms, databases—and slowly figured out how to actually build things that work. It wasn’t always glamorous (think lots of debugging and deadline stress), but it gave me a solid base and helped me discover what I enjoy in tech.",
