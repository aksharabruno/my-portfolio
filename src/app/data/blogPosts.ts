        content: [`There’s something strangely terrifying about a blank page.\n\n
        It just sits there — empty, expectant, borderline smug — daring you to say something meaningful. 
        Or at least something coherent. And somehow, the more you stare at it, the more your brain decides now is a great time to think about literally anything else. Like whether cats understand time. Or if you accidentally left the fridge door slightly open. But here’s the thing I’m learning (and re-learning every time I open a new doc): the page doesn’t need perfection. It just needs presence. Some days, that presence looks like half-baked thoughts and too many metaphors. Other days, it’s a proper idea stitched into words that mostly make sense. But most of the time, it’s messy. And that’s fine. That’s writing. Whether it’s code or a blog post or a 2 a.m. journal entry, the hardest part is often just starting. Showing up. Typing one sentence, even if it’s bad. Especially if it’s bad. Because once the page isn’t blank anymore — you’ve already won.`]

        excerpt: 'Today, I had a lovely conversation with my grandmother...',
        imageName: blog2,
        content: [`Today, I had a lovely conversation with my grandmother. We talked for a little more than usual about the “old” stories. Narratives about people who existed even before I was born. Tragic tales, funny anecdotes, all the more gave my brain a reason to dig up my memories. I got reminded of one of my best mates. Doodle, the good-est boy.`, 
            `Doodle was his birth name. For convenience sake of our maid who was the second-in-command of our home, mom renamed him “Doodoo”. He is a rajapazhayam dog, which I am told that dogs of this specific breed are normally police cadets in Tamil Nadu. And was he the brave-est boy in town? Oh boy, wish I could tell you yes. He gets frightened to his core even at the sight of water. I believe it’s a common nature among some dogs that they refuse to bath. But as soon as they are done showering, they return to chasing away the birds and discover any unwanted “treasure” from the yard. Typical. This little kid takes an extra mile of toil to prevent his baths. Mom knew his sly tactics so she made sure to chain him to a pillar before letting him know that he is finally getting cleansed.`,
            `So, there is a prior preparation. Filling up the bucket with water, bringing the cleanser and settling down a towel nearby. Ever since he figured the pattern, he knew he was doomed at the sight of mom’s groundwork. He becomes very scared that he starts to shiver. He would fiddle around and starts to cry with despair. Poor lad, I felt bad on multiple occasions that I tried to convince myself not to bathe him (which of course I didn’t give into, although I wanted to. Even you would have refused if you had seen him). After the bath, he becomes sad. He settles down in his corner, not wanting to bother anyone else. A nap is all it takes for him to be troublesome again. He was really cute.`,
            `He had this particular habitual which I loved. It’s a normal practice to have a kennel outside the house so that the dog can be on patrol in the nights. I honestly don’t know what this guy truly does. The night before bidding him goodnight he is completely fresh. He is a white dog so he looks only close to good as new (let’s be real, he loves to play…in the outside world…yes, on the mud). The following morning, I wake up to this latte colored dog throwing his murky feet on my bed and possibly even bringing a dead mouse to the porch. So, one thing was for sure. He was good at rat hunting. I’m kidding. He probably did that only a couple of times. But the number of times he got incredibly dirty was consistent on point. Reverting back to his routine….`,
            `Mom wakes up early in the morning and opens the front door around 6:00 am. Mom KNOWS how dirty he would be so she wouldn’t normally allow him inside right away. But this guy was clever enough to ensure that mom is out of sight, so he can sneak inside discreetly, come into my bedroom, roll into a bun and sleep next to my bed on the floor. Aww…. I know right. I wake up to mom’s failed attempts on trying to get him out. He still wouldn’t budge. So stubborn he was. I always had to get out of my bed to take him outside. Wherever I go, he follows :D.`,
            `Those mornings were special to me like how adding a tinge of cardamom is to tea. Sorry, off-topic. Just as how I keep diverting myself, Doodoo’s attention span was quite small. He comes to me for all the love. Nevertheless, the moment he witnesses dad eating biscuits, he doesn’t care if I exist anymore. He simply makes his way to dad, wagging his tail. Yes, Doodoo was an integral part of our lives. I do not know if the rest of my family will agree to this. However, I completely enjoyed all the good times.`,
            `Here, we reach the sad part of the story. He was only about a year and a half when he died. The gate was left open, he ran outside which no one noticed. He came back home bruised up. I guess he got into a dog fight. Seeing him pained was writhing. The vet couldn’t help much. The medicines were effect-less. Despite living only a short time, he is irreplaceable. And I think, secretly, mom loved him too, more than she would like to admit.`,
            `The one who is reading this now, please adopt a pet. May it be a dog or a cat or a fish or a hamster or a bird. For people who like to do “extra”, adopt a horse. Inculcate them into your lives and learn their tiniest quirks. The entire journey with them is wonderful. Perhaps these are everyday stories. Even so, I gather, experiences like these make oneself wholesome.`,
            `In remembrance today, and always.`]
